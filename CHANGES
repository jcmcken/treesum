Version 0.2.0
-------------

* The symlink and directory metadata generators now use the UID and GID rather
  than the user and group names.
* The parallelism of the metadata generation procedures are now overridable via
  the ``TREESUM_WORKERS`` and ``TREESUM_PER_WORKER`` environment variables, which
  configure the number of processes to launch and the number of files to feed to
  each process (respectively).
* Regular file stats are now included in the ``treesum`` computation, so that files
  now must have both the exact contents and stats for a directory to return a
  consistent checksum.
* The parallelism of metadata generation was reduced to avoid corruption issues
  under circumstances where file paths are large.
* The ``treesum`` RPM spec file now includes various documents including the license
  and README.

Version 0.1.0

* Initial implementation
